# STU-net
The code of paper 'Generative Wind Power Curve Modeling: A Self-training Deep Convolutional Network Based Method' 
## How to get started?
1 Download the model via model\Down load model via the link in this file and save the model under the folder model\UnetS4000DEAndADEepoch3.pth   
2 Upload your data in SCADAData folder with the csv format. The first column of data is wind speed, and the second column is wind power. (or you can utlize the sample.csv provide by us for quick start.  
3 Run testObservedSCADAData/main.py
