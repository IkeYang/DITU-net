# STU-net
The code of paper 'Generative Wind Power Curve Modeling Via Machine Vision: A Self-learning Deep Convolutional Network Based Method'.
## How to get started?
1 Download the model via https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XeMm9q6suX5hZb56OoaTy8tEC69LaD69/view?usp=sharing and save the model to 'model\UnetS4000DEAndADEepoch3.pth'   
2 Upload your data to 'SCADAData' folder with the csv format. The first column of the data is wind speed, and the second column is wind power. (or you can utlize the 'sample.csv' provided by us for quick start.)  
3 Run 'testObservedSCADAData/main.py'
